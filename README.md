# Simple Grammar Parser

SGParser is a parser generator and a C++ parsing library, which can be used to parse programming languages,
expressions, and other complex text files. To use it you would take several steps:
 1. Write a grammar file for the syntax you need to parse.
 2. Use the command line 'sgyacc' parser generator tool to create parse tables.
 3. Include the Parser in your C++ project. You will use the DFATokenizer and Parser classes, along with the generated parse tables to handle the parsing.
 4. Implement the ParseHandler interface; its Reduce virtual function will be called whenever a production is reduced. Here you have access to a stack of tokens and can add all of your grammar rule processing logic.

 Please see
 [Calculator sample](samples/calc/#simple-calc) source code for more details.

SGParser implements a corrected LALR “Look-Ahead Left-to-right, Rightmost derivation” parser with backtracking support.
The parser is “corrected” in that it can detect and resolve some LALR conflicts automatically.
Backtracking refers to the fact that the parser has a conceptual ability to go back and re-parse productions it encountered in the past, useful
in case the symbol is defined later on in the grammar. Doing so would require extra user-side work and is typically not necessary.

Some reasons you might want to use SGParser instead of 'yacc' include:
 * It's written in C++, so you can benefit from template customization of parse stack elements, etc.
 * You may find stand-alone grammar files cleaner and easier to write.
 * Compact LR(1) parse tables will not suffer from reduce/reduce conflicts related to LALR table merging of states.
 * You can get nice conflict reports and canonical data reports with '-cr' and '-cd' options to help debug the grammar.
 * Support for multiple starting productions, user-controlled reductions (to handle C style type-name/identifier conflict), as well as user-controlled error recovery features described in the [doc](doc/#doc) folder.

## Build

### Microsoft Visual Studio

Use Visual Studio solution file [projects\vs2019\SGParser.sln](projects/vs2019/SGParser.sln) to build complete set of components.
* Use project file [projects\vs2019\Parser\Parser.vcxproj](projects/vs2019/Parser/Parser.vcxproj) to build only Parser library.
* Use project file [projects\vs2019\ParserGen\ParserGen.vcxproj](projects/vs2019/ParserGen/ParserGen.vcxproj) to build Parser and Parser Generator libraries.
* Use project file [projects\vs2019\SGYacc\SGYacc.vcxproj](projects/vs2019/SGYacc/SGYacc.vcxproj) to build Parser library, Parser Generator library and the lexical analyzer *SGYacc*.

### CMake

There are a bunch of scripts to build the parser binaries by one command.

#### On Microsoft Windows

Run one of the following commands to build for the x86 debug, x86 release, x64 debug, and x64 release targets, respectively:
```bat
build
build --config release
build --arch x64 --config debug
build --arch x64 --config release
```
Also, compiler can be specified by using `--compiler` option:
```bat
build --arch x64 --config release --compiler clang++
```
This will generate CMake-based solutions and executables within the build folder.

The release binaries get placed into the following directories (`<arch>`, `<compiler>` and `<config>` will be replaced with actual values):
`build\<arch>-<compiler>-<config>\src\Parser\Release\parser.lib`\
`build\<arch>-<compiler>-<config>\src\ParserGen\Release\parsergen.lib`\
`build\<arch>-<compiler>-<config>\SGYacc\Release\sgyacc.exe`

For example, release build artifacts made by MSVC on Win32 platform will be:
`build\x86-msvc-release\src\Parser\Release\parser.lib`\
`build\x86-msvc-release\src\Parser\Release\parsergen.lib`\
`build\x86-msvc-release\SGYacc\Release\sgyacc.exe`

#### On Linux and macOS

Use commands shown below to build required versions of the parser executables. Please note that only 64-bit builds are supported:
```sh
./build.sh
./build.sh --config debug
./build.sh --config release
```
Also, compiler can be specified by using `--compiler` option:
```sh
./build.sh --compiler clang++ --config debug
```

The binaries get placed into the following directories (`<compiler>` and `<config>` will be replaced with actual values):
`build/x64-<compiler>-<config>/src/Parser/libparser.a`\
`build/x64-<compiler>-<config>/src/ParserGen/libparsergen.a`\
`build/x64-<compiler>-<config>/SGYacc/Debug/sgyacc`

For example, debug build artifacts made by Clang will be:
`build/x64-clang-debug/src/Parser/libparser.a`\
`build/x64-clang-debug/src/ParserGen/libparsergen.a`\
`build/x64-clang-debug/SGYacc/Release/sgyacc`

## Prebuilt binaries

We provide a set of prebuilt release versions of `sgyacc` executables for the following platforms:
- Microsoft Windows 10 64-bit
- Microsoft Windows 10 32-bit
- Ubuntu 20.04
- macOS 10.15.7

They can be found in the repository in the [prebuilt](prebuilt/#prebuilt) directory.
They can be run directly from directories they reside in.

```bat
prebuit\windows_10_x64\sgyacc.exe
```
```bat
prebuit\windows_10_x86\sgyacc.exe
```
```sh
./prebuilt/ubuntu_20.04/sgyacc
```
```sh
./prebuilt/macos_10.15.7/sgyacc
```

## Usage

To check a grammar use simple command that runs `sgyacc` against a file with the grammar definition.
```sh
sgyacc grammar.gr
```

Notice that the tool supports only forward slash symbol in file paths.

To generate the parse table, DFA (deterministic finite automata) table, and production tokens enumeration files please use flags shown below.
```sh
sgyacc grammar -dfa -pt -prodenum
```

To see the complete set of options use any of the following commands
```sh
sgyacc
sgyacc -?
```

## Samples

The repository contains examples that illustrate how to use the parser.

[See samples](samples/#samples)

## Tests

The repository contains tests for the parser.

[See tests](tests/#parser-tests)

## Acknowledgments

This library was originally developed by Michael Antonov and Brendan Iribe at Scaleform and transferred to Status Games as a part of internal programming language research work.

The grammar file format was inspired by Visual Parse++ syntax, which was a parsing tool in early 2000s,
so we would like to thank William Donahue for his work on it.
You can read about the grammar file format here:
["Parsing with Sandstone's Visual Parse++"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319851057_Parsing_with_Sandstone's_Visual_Parse).

We'd also like to thank Marshall Cline, Andrii Kondratiev, Ed Yablonski, and Eugene Medvedenko for their contribution to modernizing the code for open-source.

For additional information about handling grammar file starting productions, etc. please see [doc](doc/#doc).
